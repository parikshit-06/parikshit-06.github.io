<p>Iâ€™m <strong>Parikshit Sonwane</strong>, a final-year Aerospace Engineering student at IIT Madras. I work at the intersection of robotics, machine learning, and embedded systems â€” building intelligent machines that donâ€™t just run in simulation, but operate reliably in the real world.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve designed and flown UAVs for search-and-rescue and disaster relief, trained ML models for drone detection, and built gesture-controlled navigation systems using vision pipelines. My projects span from mechanical design and embedded control to deep learning, reinforcement learning, and full-stack system deployment on edge platforms.</p>

### ðŸ§  What I'm Interested In

- Robotics (UAVs, UUVs, multi-modal systems)  
- Real-time perception (CV, audio, sensor fusion)  
- Path planning, control systems, and RL  
- ML inference on edge hardware (Jetson, Pi)  
- Sim-to-real transfer and autonomous navigation

### ðŸ’¼ Roles I've Taken

- <strong>Head, Aero Club â€“ CFI, IIT Madras</strong>  
  I lead student UAV/Robo projects, mentor teams, and organize workshops and competitions.

- <strong>Project Lead â€“ Neptune (Amphibious UAV)</strong>  
  I led the design and testing of a drone capable of both aerial and underwater operations using custom waterproof propulsion and CFD-optimized geometry.

- <strong>Team Lead â€“ Inter-IIT Tech Meet</strong>  
  I built a fault-tolerant PX4-based UAV with onboard motor failure detection and emergency recovery logic, and demonstrated full HIL simulation.

### ðŸ§ª Currently Building

- **GestureNav:** A real-time drone navigation system controlled via hand gestures using ROS 2, MediaPipe, and PX4.  
- **Domain Adaptive Skeleton GPT-2:** A modular NLP pipeline using LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning across multiple domains.  
- **RL + LiDAR Obstacle Avoidance:** Reinforcement learning for UAV navigation using voxelized 3D LiDAR environments.
