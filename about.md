### üîß What I Do

- **Drone & UAV Systems:** From design to flight, I've built fixed-wing, amphibious, and multi-modal UAVs for applications like disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
- **Machine Learning & Computer Vision:** Trained models for gesture recognition, drone detection, and domain-adaptive NLP using frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, Hugging Face.
- **Control & Planning:** Implemented 3D A* path planning on voxelized LiDAR data, PID-based flight control in Simulink, and fault-tolerant motor failure recovery on PX4.
- **Embedded & Simulation:** Deployed systems on Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano; built full stack prototypes in ROS/ROS2, Gazebo, and MATLAB.
